# Arduino-Security-Panel-System
This project is a digital door locking system using concepts of interactive hardware. The presented content in this repository is about a prototype developed according to the proposed design as a part of the final project of the semester. This project is an extension of Security Panel System by [Mert Arduino](http://mertarduinotutorial.blogspot.com/2017/01/arduino-tutorial-22-security-panel.html).

## Usage
To assemble this system gather the materials mentioned in Requirements and Materials. Connect each and every hardware component according to the Build instructions.

Then follow the below steps to upload the code to Arduino Mega:

* Connect USB cable of arduino to the PC.
* Open Arduino IDE then goto  File->New or press ctrl+N.
* Then goto tools->Port and select the COM port for Arduino Mega 2560.
* Copy the code from [Arduino-Mega_Code.ino] (https://github.com/trushil/Arduino-Security-Panel-System/blob/master/src/Arduino-Mega_Code.ino) and paste it in Arduino sketch.
* Download all the libraries from [here](https://github.com/trushil/Arduino-Security-Panel-System/tree/master/libraries). Then go to Documents\Arduino\libraries and pase them here.
* Compile the sketch by clicking the check button below file option or press ctrl+R.
* After the sketch gets compiled with no errors press the right arrow button below edit option or press ctrl+U to upload the sketch to Arduino Mega 2560.

# Arduino-Security-Panel-System
This project is a digital door locking system using concepts of interactive hardware. The presented content in this repository is about a prototype developed according to the proposed design as a part of the final project of the semester. This project is an extension of Security Panel System by [Mert Arduino](http://mertarduinotutorial.blogspot.com/2017/01/arduino-tutorial-22-security-panel.html).

## Usage
To assemble this system gather the materials mentioned in Requirements and Materials. Connect each and every hardware component according to the Build instructions.

### Follow these steps to upload the code to Arduino Mega 2560:

* Connect USB cable of arduino to the PC.
* Open Arduino IDE then goto  File->New or press Ctrl+N.
* Then goto Tools->Port and select the COM port for Arduino Mega 2560 (for Mac users it would be something like /dev/tty).
* Copy the code from [Arduino-Mega_Code.ino](https://github.com/trushil/Arduino-Security-Panel-System/blob/master/src/Arduino-Mega_Code.ino) and paste it in Arduino sketch.
* Download all the libraries from [here](https://github.com/trushil/Arduino-Security-Panel-System/tree/master/libraries). Then go to Documents\Arduino\libraries and pase them here.
* Compile the sketch by clicking the check button below file option or press ctrl+R.
* After the sketch gets compiled with no errors press the right arrow button below edit option or press ctrl+U to upload the sketch to Arduino Mega 2560.

Now before uploading the code to ESP8266 ESP-12E UART WIFI Shield we need to manipulate the DIP buttons on the shield. For more details refer to this [link](https://medium.com/@manrick01/arduino-uno-esp8266-esp-12e-uart-wifi-wireless-shield-3a39858e5f25). We can also upload the sketch to the ESP8266 ESP-12E UART WIFI Shield with the help of Arduino Uno or Mega 2560.

### Follow these steps to upload the code to ESP8266 ESP-12E UART WIFI Shield using Arduino Uno:
* Before connecting align the DIP buttons to (DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP) from 1 to 4 respectively.
* **Connections:** Make the connections from Arduino Uno to Wifi shield according to the table below.

    | Arduino Uno   | ESP8266 ESP-12E UART WIFI Shield |
    | ------------- |----------------------------------|
    | Rx            | Rx                               |
    | Tx            | Tx                               |
    | GND           | GND                              |
    | +3.3V         | +3.3V                            |
    |   Connect  RESET pin of Arduino Uno to GND       |

* After the above connections are made, follow next step.

* Open you IDE and click on "File -> Preferences".
* In  "Aditional Boards Manager URLs" add this line and click on "OK": "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json"
* Go to "Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager", type "ESP8266" and install it.
* Go again to "Tools -> Board" and select "Generic ESP8266 Module".
* Copy the code from [here](https://github.com/trushil/Arduino-Security-Panel-System/blob/master/src/ESP8266-HTTP_Server.ino) and paste it in the Arduino IDE.
* Then compile the sketch and upload it the same way it was done for Arduino Mega.
